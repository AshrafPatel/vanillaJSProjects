#JavaScript Projects

This is some projects which I created mostly with a little assistance the old ones are when I first started developing in JavaScript. Since then I have developed my skills considerably I done these mainly following a tutorial and dont claim them as my own however as a programmer/student even if this is not my work I understand the concepts and can now create something similar the main reason I done these projects is to understand UI/UX design and fill a few gaps along the way.
